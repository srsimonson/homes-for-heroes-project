# HOMES FOR HEROES PROJECT

Hello! Welcome to my submission for the Homes for Heroes Project. Demo of a full-stack CRUD application using Vue.js, Laravel PHP, and mysql MariaDB. All of these technologies were new to me, so all work, including setting up all new environments, came from a baseline of no prior knowledge.

To view the project, go to https://github.com/srsimonson/homes-for-heroes-project and click the green code button to clone or download zip.

To start the project, first run npm install.

Contact the database adminstrator to create a username and password to enter into the .env
    DB_DATABASE= < ... >
    DB_USERNAME= < ... >
    DB_PASSWORD= < ... >

php artisan serve runs the app locally on http://127.0.0.1:8000/
